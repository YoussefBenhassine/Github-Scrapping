# Github-Scrapping
This project focuses on analyzing GitHub repository data and presenting insights through interactive dashboards.


# Description
In this context, my project aims to design and implement a customized dashboard tailored to the specific needs of Mobelite, providing relevant and actionable insights to support growth and success in a constantly evolving business environment.

The goal is to design a Data Warehouse by leveraging various data sources to build a complete Business Intelligence (BI) solution, including the development of dynamic dashboards in the next phase.

# Problem Statement
The existing dashboards available on GitHub help streamline the process, but they are limited in terms of the specific indicators we aim to track.

Therefore, our objective is to extract all relevant data, transform it, and enable its manipulation in a simple, fast, and efficient way.

# Objective
This project involves the development of an application that enables the analysis and monitoring of various key performance indicators.

The application should fulfill the following objectives:

  - Ensure daily data updates

  - Create a Data Warehouse to support the dashboards

  - Provide a comprehensive view of all available data

  - Enable the generation of dynamic dashboards
